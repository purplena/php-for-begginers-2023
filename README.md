I decided to keep for personal use the code that was created by [Jeffrey Way](https://github.com/JeffreyWay) as a part of his course [PHP for Beginners](https://laracasts.com/series/php-for-beginners-2023-edition)  at [laracasts.com](https://laracasts.com/) 
Here there are 4 sections: 

SECTION 1 The Fundamentals

SECTION 2 Dynamic Web Applications

SECTION 3 Notes Mini-Project

SECTION 4 Project Organization
